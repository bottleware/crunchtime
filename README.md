# Idea
A time block visualization project that lets users know when its impossible to complete their tasks
* The app focuses on the amount of time remaining in a day and the total remaining length of tasks that a user asigns daily (its essentially a count down clock with current time and minutes to midnight against total task time)
* The users tasks are represented as a hollow pie chart where each section represents a task and its size corresponds to the length of the task
* The day ends at midnight, so when it becomes physically impossible to complete all tasks based off, the app will let the user know that its impossible and that they are "screwed".
* When it is impossible to complete everything in a day, the user can choose to remove a task off of the chart to add time to the clock.
* When users complete a task maybe there's a cool animation or fireworks or party streamers or something idk. same when they give up/run out of time
